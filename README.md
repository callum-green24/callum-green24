Kia Ora my names Callum and I'm and Auckland based Web Developer.

Recently started this journey into tech and I am loving it so far. I have recently completed a full-stack course at Development Academy the pinned repositories are some of the projects I collaborated on along the way. 
As well as my very first attempt at HTML and CSS which is fun to look back on. I am keen to continue my learning and collaborate on projects I find exciting. 

I am currently working on my personal Calorie-Tracker app, a collaborative App called TripHive and my Personal Profile.

Skills Languages: JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, SQL Frameworks and Libraries: React, Node.js
